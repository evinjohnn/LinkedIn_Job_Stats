# Privacy Policy for LinkedIn Job Stats Extension

**Last Updated:** August 2025

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how the "LinkedIn Job Stats" browser extension ("we," "our," or "us") handles information when you use our extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Extension Description

The LinkedIn Job Stats Extension is a browser extension that enhances the LinkedIn job searching experience by providing real-time job statistics, including applicant counts and view metrics, directly on LinkedIn job listings pages.

## Data Collection and Usage

### **We Do Not Collect Personal Data**

This extension is designed with user privacy as our top priority. We want to be completely clear about our data practices:

- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data or user information.
- **No External Servers**: The extension does not have any external servers and does not send any data to third-party services.
- **Local Processing Only**: All processing of information required for the extension's functionality occurs locally on your computer within your web browser.
- **No Tracking**: We do not track your browsing habits, job searches, or any other online activities.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use analytics tools or tracking pixels.

### What the Extension Does

The extension works by:
1. Intercepting network requests to LinkedIn's internal APIs (Voyager API) when you view job postings
2. Extracting job statistics (views, applications) from these API responses
3. Displaying this information in a user-friendly interface on the LinkedIn page
4. Storing job statistics locally in your browser's extension storage (only accessible to you)

### Data Storage

The only data stored by the extension is:
- Job statistics (views, applications, job IDs) in your browser's local extension storage
- This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted anywhere
- You can clear this data by uninstalling the extension or clearing your browser data

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **Storage**: To save job statistics locally in your browser
- **Scripting** (Standard Version): To inject scripts that intercept LinkedIn API calls
- **Debugger** (CDP Version): To use Chrome DevTools Protocol for network interception
- **Active Tab**: To access the current LinkedIn tab for data extraction
- **Host Permissions**: To access LinkedIn.com for the extension to function

These permissions are necessary for the extension to function and do not grant us access to your personal data.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or external APIs. The extension operates entirely within your browser and only interacts with LinkedIn's public APIs to extract job statistics.

## Children's Privacy

Our extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Uninstall the extension at any time
